        <p>TNA's CCD role is to ensure access to the TNA collections through preservation and enabling display,
          innovative
          sector-leading treatment and research, documentation and environmental management. Two of the department’s key
          strategy
          objectives are its practitioner-researcher approach, in that the traditional division between conservation and
          heritage
          science is viewed as anachronistic and progressive development of the department that relied on a holistic and
          integrated approach. Knowledge is derived from all aspects of the department's work. The second is to harness
          the
          knowledge of the department for use by different partners and communities and collaboratively build new
          knowledge beyond
          TNA.
     
      </p>
      <p>
        The Existing System and Fragmentation

        Like most organisational database systems the CCD's old system was largely administrative focussing on the basic
        throughput of conservation work in the department. In hindsight, it provided very little knowledge about the
        actual
        processes, skills, and methods used with the varied items in TNA collection. There were basic but restricted
        benefits in
        terms of understanding how the department worked and developed. Most of the actual knowledge was spread across
        different
        types of recording mostly documents and spreadsheets, but disconnected and underused. The database had been
        extended
        over time but these extensions were pragmatic and not well integrated generating further fragmentation. The
        increasing
        gap between an essentially static system and the actual workings of the department represented a common problem.
        Therefore the objective for the TNA project was to create a system that could grow with the department and
        connect all
        the knowledge it generated in a form that could bring internal benefits, but crucially, be reused externally. By
        reforming this aspect of their work it could underpin their strategy and reach more people.
        An Evolutionary Approach
      </p>
      <p>
        Legacy databases can be difficult and expensive to change because of their technical inflexibility. Limited
        semantics
        and logic are built into the software, not the data, making the system dependent on technicians not invested in
        the
        content. The hidden cost was that, in not reflecting the reality of the department’s processes and strategy, it
        created
        both a resourcing overhead and an intellectual overhead that worked against professional development. Data went
        into the
        system but had no real objective. Professionals were servicing a system which provided little return providing
        little
        insight into how people approached and developed their work or how methods and techniques had changed overtime.
        It was a
        record with little educational or management benefit. However, CCD did not have the time necessary to stop and
        conduct a
        detailed review of the department in one major exercise. Using ResearchSpace meant that an evolutionary route
        was
        possible and the system itself became a tool for change and new thinking. Initially the old data, which was
        still
        required, was cleaned and migrated to the CIDOC CRM, creating semantically explicit information in a flexible
        structure
        - a graph. Semantic data is higher quality and more precise but works within a flexible model which can be
        influenced
        more easily by subject experts themselves. Once the system was migrated to the new framework it could be
        developed
        collaboratively with a common goal to be transparent, educational, incorporate research, and better address new
        challenges. Disruption to the department was kept to a minimum and the system simply continued to change and
        grow
        incrementally. The data clean and semantic transformation was completed incrementally over a period of 4 weeks.
        The
        system was created from scratch in a similar time span providing a custom system without the usual timescale,
        resources
        and cost. Driven from the data, not the software, a custom system could be created without the need for custom
        support.
        The key ingredient was Kartography's understanding of the subject area, alongside its expertise in semantic
        technology.

      </p>
      <p>
        Once a working system was available it was incorporated into the department immediately. This allowed the space
        for a
        fuller information exchange about how the department worked, how different sections within the department
        collaborated
        and how the department collaborated within the organisation and externally. It also allowed Kartography to
        describe how
        the new system operated and the possibilities available to people for its use in supporting the current
        practices of the
        department and to improve the system to make it more relevant, gradually introducing the concepts behind
        semantic data
        and new ways of thinking about data.
        Integration
      </p>
      CCD used the records from the TNA Discovery system which documents the archive using the EAD system. The
      ResearchSpace
      system is able to connect with legacy API's and databases and dynamically convert data into a semantic format as
      and
      when needed. A Discovery interface was provided that allows CCD to find and import records from Discovery
      maintaining a
      link between the two. This also allows CCD to augment the records with material, scientific and historical
      information,
      including social and historical significance which is highly relevant to preservation and conservation processes.
      Evolving the System
      <p>
        A review was undertaken in the context of the CCD strategy and a new version of the system was completed which
        incorporated an interconnected interface based on a project approach. However, projects are not simply separate
        standalone pieces of work. Projects are linked allowing past work to inform future work and provide a provenance
        of
        methods and techniques that can be traced. Collection items and the activities around them have a life which can
        now be
        traced and used to understand change and new developments. Complexity is supported by allowing CCD to break
        archive
        items up into components and features from which specific regions and points can be identified and used for
        precise
        representation of assessments, analysis, research and treatments that they carry out without resorting to
        interpreting
        text fields which previously were the only way to describe details. Version three of the system will focus on
        scientific
        integration and significance analysis.
