				<p>
				All organisations rely on knowledge, however, this knowledge can be fragemented in many
        different places creating process silos and duplication. Valuable knowledge dissappears when people leave the 
        organisation.
        All professionals making judgements and decisions based on qualitative and quantitative information, 
        and who themselves generate important 
        knowledge for future planning and strategy, can make use of ResearchSpace. For example, ResearchSpace at The National 
        Archives recognises and represents
        everyday work in a content form that makes its a valuable resource for education, training, partnertship, strategy and 
        engagement. 
				</p>
        <p>It is extremely hard for organisations to measure the qualitative impact of knowledge in the work place.
          However, it is a common problem for professionals to complain about the overhead and limitations that 
          fragmentation and inappropriate information systems based on on one dimensional databases have on their work. 
          This is commonn across the 
          commercial and public sectors. Moreover process analysis of productivity often glosses over these overheads
          and fails to take them into account which means that problems are petutated and the same mistakes in the 
          implementation of information systems it made again and again.
