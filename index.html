        <p class="sectitle"><b>Who are Kartography?</b></p>
        <p>Kartography are an interdisciplinary team drawing upon extensive experience of working in knowledge
          organisations including the Royal College of Arts,
          the British Museum and the National Gallery. 
          Kartography are the designers and developers of
          <a href="http://www.researchspace.org">ResearchSpace</a>, a knowledge base
          platform
          that supports evolving knowledge processes using meaningful context. 
          <p>The nature of knowledge production has changed significantly over the last 50 years. It has become broader 
            and transdisciplinary, dynamic and processural. Digital frameworks need to incorporate
          knowledge that can meaningfully evolve over time, with provenance, but most information systems employ static models 
          without the flexibility and semantics to
          address complex questions, whether in education and research or other
          information rich sectors.</p>

            <p class="sectitle"><b>What is ResearchSpace?</b></p>

        <p> <a href="http://www.researchspace.org">ResearchSpace</a> is an open source system with
          over 10 years of research and development funded by the Mellon Foundation (New York). ResearchSpace has 
          been designed to address many of the problems associated with representing complex data
          that databases or database appraches are not designed to address. For more information about how ResearchSpace works <a
            href="./researchspace.html">

        <!--<p><b>databases - complexity - commercial - static - functional - reductive</b></p>-->



        <p class="sectitle"><b>How does ResearchSpace work?</b></p>
        <p>In order for different system to effectively communicate they need a common understanding. When we
          communicate
          we use different words and phrases to describe similar things. When information is processed through computers
          this
          can cause serious problems. Every organisation is individual and has different
          perspectives and traditions.
        </p>
          <p>The ResearchSpace Knowledge base provides an overarching framework based on real world empirical concepts providing a 
          solid semantic referent for data.
          In this way both human and computer have common framework under which heterogenious information can be
          represented
          and interconnected, and provide a better basis for AI. The flexibility needed for human knowledge processes is 
          supported but with all the advantages
          of computer processesing to cope with large amounts of data but essentially based on meaningful qualitative 
          information.
          Instead of a database that only stores a
          field label and a value with a
          data type, ResearchSpace stores an effective semantic network of processes typed to the real world. This creates
          a highly effective knowledge base of information which can be dynamically extended and exchanged. </p>

        <p class="sectitle"><b>How does kartography do?</b></p>
        <p>Kartography helps you move from the constraints of instrumental, abstract, one dimensional thinking, to a new digital
          environment in which a wider range of knowledge can be authored with greater context and diversity.
          It helps design systems that include parallel perspectives, argument and uncertainty,
          and multi-layered causation (influence). It provides transdisciplinary capability and the ability to include social and historical context. 
          This often goes hand in hand with reviewing and changing internal
          processes to represent greater collaboration within and across departments and with external partners and
          audiences.</p>

        <p>Kartography are experienced at creating flexible knowledge systems that grow and evolve as human working
          evolves without the overhead of a traditional bespoke system. All the meaning and logic is in the data making
          it
          easier to change the way ResearchSpace interacts and augments knowledge processes and decision making. </p>

        <p>Kartography provides courses in how to change the way people work to make better use of the knowledge they
          produce. To
          radical change the relationship with information systems and to create data systems that eliminate bias and
          represent context that improves inclusivity. It also provides connected courses in the technicalities
          of the Semantic Web and Linked data without separating the technical processes from social context. </p>
