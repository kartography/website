        <p>This multidisciplinary project is particularly concerned with heritage science for conservation using different types and sources of data. It is a collaborative effort involving the synthesis of information from different collections and using the native Semantic Linked Data environment of ResearchSpace, a natural and flexible environment, enabling the full benefits of the CIDOC CRM ontology.</p>

      <p class="sectitle"><b>What is ResearchSpace?</b></p>

      <p> <a href="http://www.researchspace.org">ResearchSpace</a> is an open source system with
        over 10 years of research and development funded by the Mellon Foundation (New York). ResearchSpace has
        been designed to address many of the problems associated with representing complex data
        that databases or database appraches are not designed to address. For more information about how ResearchSpace
        works <a href="./researchspace.html">
          click here</a></p>

      <!--<p><b>databases - complexity - commercial - static - functional - reductive</b></p>-->

      <p class="sectitle"><b>How does ResearchSpace work?</b></p>
      <p>In order for different system to effectively communicate they need a common understanding. When we
        communicate
        we use different words and phrases to describe similar things. When information is processed through computers
        this
        can cause serious problems. Every organisation is individual and has different
        perspectives and traditions.
      </p>
      <p>The ResearchSpace Knowledge base provides an overarching framework based on real world empirical concepts
        providing a
        solid semantic referent for data.
        In this way both human and computer have common framework under which heterogenious information can be
        represented
        and interconnected, and provide a better basis for AI. The flexibility needed for human knowledge processes is
        supported but with all the advantages
        of computer processesing to cope with large amounts of data but essentially based on meaningful qualitative
        information.
        Instead of a database that only stores a
        field label and a value with a
        data type, ResearchSpace stores an effective semantic network of processes typed to the real world. This creates
        a highly effective knowledge base of information which can be dynamically extended and exchanged. </p>

      <p class="sectitle"><b>What does kartography do?</b></p>
      <p>Kartography helps you move from the constraints of instrumental, abstract, one dimensional thinking, to a new
        digital
        environment in which a wider range of knowledge can be authored with greater context and diversity.
        It helps design systems that include parallel perspectives, argument and uncertainty,
        and multi-layered causation (influence). It provides transdisciplinary capability and the ability to include
        social and historical context.
        This often goes hand in hand with reviewing and changing internal
        processes to represent greater collaboration within and across departments and with external partners and
        audiences.</p>

      <p>Kartography are experienced at creating flexible knowledge systems that grow and evolve as human working
        evolves without the overhead of a traditional bespoke system. All the meaning and logic is in the data making
        it
        easier to change the way ResearchSpace interacts and augments knowledge processes and decision making. </p>

      <p>Kartography provides courses in how to change the way people work to make better use of the knowledge they
        produce. To
        radical change the relationship with information systems and to create data systems that eliminate bias and
        represent context that improves inclusivity. It also provides connected courses in the technicalities
        of the Semantic Web and Linked data without separating the technical processes from social context. </p>
