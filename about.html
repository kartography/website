          <b>Designing and implementing a knowledge base</b>
			
				<p>
			Kartography creates knowledge base system which are highly semantic, dynamic and effective. It can design new systems or transform 
      existing database systems aligning with processes and supporting a whole range
      of knowledge based activities. It provides a basis for interconnecting internal systems or connecting with external information sources.
      The knowledge base helps you to understand you and others understand and better use your information for decision making, education, research,
      strategy, engagement and partnership. The knowledge base has no functional constrainst and can evolve as your work or organisation evolves without 
      the costs associated with custom systems. ResearchSpace breaks the mould by creating effectiveness and efficiency through flexbility and change 
      not though locked down data models.

 <b>Data to knowledge transformation</b>

<p>Kartography can work with you to understand your knowledge processes providing experience and expertise 
  to inform a new knowledge base. Often existing processes have been influenced to service an existing database 
  system. Kartography can help re-evaluate these processes to represent actual workflows.
   This work can be informed by longer term strategies and evolve over time. A knowledge base is technology
    used to author and store more complex expert information which can be used for more than reference and
     administration and provide a more effective, creative and collaborative resource.</p>

     <b>Knowledge Processes</b>

<p>Kartography can work with you to understand your knowledge processes providing experience and 
  expertise to inform a new knowledge base. Often existing processes have been influenced to service
  an existing database system. Kartography can help re-evaluate these processes to represent actual workflows. 
  Since a knowledge base system can evolve over time, this work can be informed by longer term strategies.
</p>

<b>Semantic Experience</b>

<p>Kartography designs interfaces that reflect thinking processes that can be changed over time 
  to reflect changes in thinking. Using the ResearchSpace system allows people to generate their own 
  models of information based on this changing knowledge. The ResearchSpace system is designed to bring out 
  meaning and encourage new thinking rather than impose technical constraints.

<b>Knowledge Process Training</b>

<p>Kartography provides standard and bespoke training courses that can help people work effectively 
  with data, regardless of your technical expertise. Kartography teaches non-technical
  subject experts to understand and make use of semantic link data in their everyday work, and 
  supporting larger scale projects.</p>


<b>Interdisciplinary Humanities & Social Science Research Partnership</b>

<p>Kartography draws upon extensive experience of working within Cultural Heritage including the Royal Academy of Arts, 
  the British Museum and the National Gallery. Kartography expertise includes historical and social science methodology 
  and specialisms like Ethnography and Anthropology, Egyptology, Conservation and Conservation Science, and Art History. 
  This allows Kartography to add significant value to heritage and humanities projects providing interdisciplinary expertise. 
  This includes a specialism in knowledge engineering using linked data and ontologies.
</p>

  <b>The Home of ResearchSpace</b>

<p>Kartography consists of the team that designed and developed the ResearchSpace 
  semantic knowledge system at the British Museum. The ResearchSpace system is an open 
  source system based on 13 years of critical research into the foundations of digital research 
  methods in the humanities. Its design is backed by an extensive empirical investigation into the 
  use of computers in historical and social research. Kartography provides custom versions of ResearchSpace
  without the same overhead as bespoke software because the data holds the meaning and logic, not the software. 
  It provides different ways to represent and author data depending on the nature of the content.
