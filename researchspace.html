				<p>
				ResearchSpace is a native Linked Data environment. However,Linked data is only a structute. The key to 
        the ResearchSpace Design is the way in which it deals with data. ResearchSpace is a response to
        the need to represent complex data narratives (like those used in writing textual narrative) in way that
        supports human networks of knowledge. It addresses the challenge of meaningful data at scale, integration 
        of data through context, representing transformation of history of society, rather than static administrative
        or reference records, and providing a far better basis for the use of AI.
      </p>

			<div class="row"><b>The ResearchSpace System - Knowledge Patterns</b>
				<p>
					A knowledge pattern is a template statement based on ontological committment which allows
          relational statements to be added, retrieved or deleted from the knowledge base.   
				</p>
				<p>
			  These patterns can be simple, like one relational statement connecting one process to another. For example,
        "An Influence - was manifest in - Activity". This pattern can be used with other simple patterns. Another
        pattern might be - "Activity took place at Place". Alternatively, these two statement might be used together 
        in one pattern, depending on the the focus of attention.  
				</p>
        <p>These patterns are used in many of the tools within ResearchSpace. The system comes with a large number of
          precompiled patterns using the CIDOC CRM. The integrity of the CIDOC-CRM means that this auto generation can 
          derived from the its robust logic, but this is not the case with all so ontologies.   
        </p>





			</div>
			<div class="row"><b>The ResearchSpace System - Semantic Forms</b>
				<p>
					ResearchSpace links together knowledge patterns to make larger patterns of information. Semantic forms
          look like standard form inouts but support hierarchical authoring and multiple connections between information.
          This makes semantic forms a more powerful data input tool because the connections are meaningful and 
          interpretable by the both computer and human alike.
          
          Semantically driven data, allows for greater complexity, and this means that systems can support 
          many differnt subjectand process areas in the same knowledge base - supporting collaborative working.
