        <p>
          ResearchSpace is a native Linked Data environment. While Linked data allows structures
          that support networks of data, unlike database systems, Linked Data is only a structure which
          by itself addresses very little. </p>
        <p>The key to the ResearchSpace Design and to semantic networks is the representation of content</p>
        <p>Linked data has been primarily used as a publication mechanism for legacy data. This does not make the
          data better, address context, inclusivity and diversity</p>

        </p>
        <p>
          ResearchSpace is a response to the gap between subject experts and digital publication. The need to represent
          complex - relative to databases - meaningful data narratives -like those used in writing textual narrative -
          in way
          that supports human networks of knowledge augmented by computers. It addresses the challenge of meaningful
          qualitative
          data at scale, integration of data through context, representing transformation of history of society, rather
          than
          static administrative or reference records, and providing a far better basis for the use of AI.

      <div class="row"><p><b>The ResearchSpace System - Knowledge Patterns</b></p>
        <p>
          A knowledge pattern is a template statement based on ontological committment which allows
          relational statements to be added, retrieved or deleted from the knowledge base.
        </p>
        <p>
          These patterns can be simple, like one relational statement connecting one process to another. For example,
          "An Influence - was manifest in - Activity". This pattern can be used with other simple patterns. Another
          pattern might be - "Activity took place at Place". Alternatively, these two statement might be used together
          in one pattern, depending on the the focus of attention.
        </p>
        <p>These patterns are used in many of the tools within ResearchSpace. The system comes with a large number of
          precompiled patterns using the CIDOC CRM. The integrity of the CIDOC-CRM means that this auto generation can
          derived from the its robust logic, but this is not the case with all so ontologies.

        <p>
          ResearchSpace links together knowledge patterns to make larger patterns of information. Semantic forms
          look like standard form inouts but support hierarchical authoring and multiple connections between
          information.
          This makes semantic forms a more powerful data input tool because the connections are meaningful and
          interpretable by the both computer and human alike.

          Semantically driven data, allows for greater complexity, and this means that systems can support
          many differnt subjectand process areas in the same knowledge base - supporting collaborative working.
