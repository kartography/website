British Museum director resigned over thefts, sources say

Growing belief among staff that Hartwig Fischer’s decision to leave was result of discovery of thefts as institution comes under scrutiny

British Museum staff allege its director’s announcement last month that he is to step down in 2024 was prompted by the thefts of priceless objects, as he faced calls to quit immediately.

Hartwig Fischer, who has been director of the museum since 2016, said in July that he was going to “pass on the leadership” of the museum next year.

There is a growing belief among staff at the museum that his decision to leave was a result of the discovery of the thefts of an unspecified number of objects dating as far back at 1,500BC. Earlier the same month the museum had sacked Peter Higgs, its curator of Mediterranean cultures, after an internal investigation into the matter. Mr Higgs denies wrongdoing.

His deputy, Jonathan Williams, is also likely to come under pressure. The Telegraph has learnt that an independent investigation into the thefts has been handed correspondence dating to February 2021 in which Mr Williams was alerted to the thefts. A whistleblower has told the inquiry that inaction led to “two wasted years” in which opportunities to recover some of the stolen items might have been lost.

The entire management of the museum, including its chairman, George Osborne, is under scrutiny following the revelation that a thief was able to plunder objects from its vaults for at least seven years without being caught.

One Roman artefact worth up to £50,000 which was stolen from a storeroom at the museum was offered for sale on eBay in 2016 with a minimum bid of £40.

The delay in taking action has led to questions about a possible cover up to prevent embarrassment for the museum. One academic who asked to study objects in storage — which they now believe to be among the stolen items – was told they were “in conservation”.

One senior source within the museum said that there was shock internally that a senior curator with 30 years’ service was being blamed for the theft of multiple objects, and that the trustees “needed someone to blame”.

Ultimate responsibility for security – and the museum’s reputation – rests with Mr Fischer, and one insider said he had been allowed to announce his departure “on his own terms”.

Another art world source said: “He was sent on his way with flying colours. This is how it is done in the establishment. But for the sake of the museum he should go now. The museum deserves better management than it has at present.”

Other sources at the museum disputed the idea that German-born Mr Fischer made plans to leave because of the impending scandal.
All departments on high alert

The museum has been criticised over its incomplete cataloguing system, which does not include photographs of all eight million objects in its collection online, meaning dealers in antiquities have no way of checking whether an item might have been stolen. The thief appears to have initially targeted uncatalogued items, before trying to sell objects that had been photographed and triggered the warning to Mr Williams.

One art world source claimed that the reason the museum did not act sooner was that the list of items it had been given in 2021 were all found not to be missing, leading to a delay in discovering the thefts.

All departments at the museum have now been placed on “high alert”, sources say, and the potential for thefts to have spread beyond the departments that are known to have been plundered has not been ruled out.

Staff involved in arranging loans from other museums have been tasked with giving assurances to other institutions about how securely their on-loan treasures are stored at the British Museum.

But countries campaigning for the repatriation of “stolen” treasures owned by the museum have made capital out of the situation.

Linda Mendoni, the Greek culture minister, whose country has long campaigned for the return of the Elgin Marbles, said the situation was “serious and sad” and her ministry was paying “close attention” to the case.

The Metropolitan Police is investigating the thefts but has not made any arrests.

A spokesman for the museum said it was “categorically wrong” to suggest there was any link between Mr Fischer’s intended departure and the thefts, and “categorically” rejected any suggestion of a cover-up.

On the subject of the tip-off to Mr Williams, the spokesman said the thefts were the subject of a police investigation and so they could not comment further.

The British Museum said: “This is all now subject to a police investigation as well as the independent review. We cannot comment further.”
