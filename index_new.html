                                The TNA's CCD role is to ensure access to the TNA collections through preservation and display, innovative sector-leading treatment and research, 
                                documentation and environmental management. The department had develeoped two key strategy objectives. The first was based on a practitioner-researcher approach in that 
                                the traditional division between conservation and science is viewed as anachronistic and progressive development of the department relied on a holistic and integrated
                                approach. Knowledge was derived from all aspects of the departments work. 
                            </p>


                        <h4 class="my-3">The Existing System</h4>

                            <p class="text-muted">
                                Like most organisational database systems (for example, collection and conservation) it was considered largely administrative focussing on the basic throughput of 
                                conservation work going through the department. In hindsight, it provided very little knowledge about the actual processes, skills, and methods used with the varied 
                                items in the TNA collection. There were few benefits in terms of understanding how the department worked and developed. Most of the actual knowledge was spread across different 
                                types of repository, mostly documents and spreadsheets, but disconnected and underused. The database had been 
                                extended over time but these extensions were pragmatic and not well integrated generating further fragmentation. The increasing gap between what was an essentially 
                                static system and the actual workings of the department are typical. Therefore the objective for the TNA project was to create a system that could grow with the 
                                department and representing and connecting all the knowledge it generated, creating benefits internally, but also crucially, externally. By reforming this aspect of their work it 
                                could underpin their strategy and reach more people.  
                            </p>


                        <h4 class="my-3">An Evolutionary Approach</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Legacy databases can be difficult and expensive to change because of their technical inflexibility. Semantics and logic are built into 
                            the software, not the data, making the system dependent on technicians not invested in the content. The hidden cost is that, in not reflecting the reality of the department’s 
                            processes and strategy, it created an overhead. Data went into the 
                            system but had no real objective and therefore people were servicing a system which provided little return at any level. However, CCD did not have the time necessary to 
                            stop and conduct a detailed review of the department in one major exercise. Using ResearchSpace meant that an evolutionary route was possible. Initially the old data, which was 
                            still required, was cleaned and migrated to the CIDOC CRM, creating semantically explicit information in a flexible structure - a graph. Semantic data is higher quality 
                            and is more precise but works within a flexible model which can be influenced more easily by subject experts themselves. 
                            Once the system was migrated to the new framework it could be developed collaboratively with a common goal to be transparent, educational 
                            and better address new challenges. Disruption to the department was kept to a minimum and the system simply continued to change and grow incrementally. 
                            The data clean and semantic transformation was completed incrementally over a period of 4 weeks. The system was created from scratch in a similar time span providing
                            a custom system without the usual timescale and resources. Driven from the data, not the software, a custom system could be created without the need for custome support. The 
                            Key ingredient was kartography's understanding of the subject area, not just semantic technology.    

                         </p>

                         <h4 class="my-3">People</h4>

                         <p class="text-muted">
                            Once a working system was available it was incorporated into the department immediately. This allowed the space for a fuller information exchange 
                            about how the department worked, how different sections within the department collaborated and how the department collaborated within the organisation 
                            and externally. It also allowed Kartography to describe how the new system operated and the possibilities available to people for its use in supporting 
                            the current practices of the department and to improve the system to make it more relevant, gradually introducing the concepts behind semantic data 
                            and new ways of thinking about data.
      
                         </p>

                         <p class="text-muted">
                            CCD used the records from the TNA Discovery system which documents the archive using the EAD system. The ResearchSpace system is able to connect
                            with API's and databases and dynamically convert them to a semantic format. A ResearchSpace - Discovery interface was provided that allows CCD to 
                            find and import records from Discovery maintaining a link between the two. This also allows CCD to augment the records with material, scientific and historical 
                            information including social and historical significant which is highly relevant to preservation and conservation processes.

                            A review was undertaken in the context of the CCD strategy and a new version of the system was completed which incorporated an interconnected interface
                            based on a project approach. However, projects are not simply separate standalone pieces of work. Projects are able to be linked allowing past work to 
                            inform future work and allow a provenance of methods and techniques that can be traced. Collection items and the activities around them have a life which 
                            can now be traced and used to understand change and new developments. Complexity is supported by allowing CCD to break archive items up into components 
                            and features from which specific regions and points can be identified and used for precise representation of assessments, analysis, research and treatments that they carry out without resorting to interpretating text 
                            fields which previously were the only way to describe details.
