                            system is an open source system based on 13 years of critical research into the foundations of 
                            digital research methods in the humanities. Its design is backed by an extensive empirical 
                            investigation into the use of computers in historical and social research. Kartography provides 
                            custom versions of ResearchSpace without the same overhead as bespoke software because the data 
                            holds the meaning and logic, not the software. It provides different ways to represent and author

                                TNA's CCD role is to ensure access to the TNA collections through preservation 
                                and enabling display, innovative sector-leading treatment and research, 
                                documentation and environmental management. Two of the department’s key 
                                strategy objectives are its  practitioner-researcher approach, in that the 
                                traditional division between conservation and heritage science is viewed as 
                                anachronistic and progressive development of the department that relied on a 
                                holistic and integrated approach. Knowledge is derived from all aspects of the 
                                department's work. The second is to harness the knowledge of the department for 
                                use by different partners and communities and collaboratively build new knowledge beyond TNA.

                        <h4 class="my-3">The Existing System and Fragmentation</h4>

                            <p class="text-muted">
                                Like most organisational database systems the CCD's old system 
                                was largely administrative focussing on the basic throughput of 
                                conservation work in the department. In hindsight, it provided very 
                                little knowledge about the actual processes, skills, and methods used with
                                 the varied items in TNA collection. There were basic but restricted benefits in 
                                 terms of understanding how the department worked and developed. Most of the actual 
                                 knowledge was spread across different types of recording mostly documents and spreadsheets, 
                                 but disconnected and underused. The database had been extended over time but these extensions 
                                 were pragmatic and not well integrated generating further fragmentation. The increasing 
                                 gap between an essentially static system and the actual workings of the department 
                                 represented a common problem. Therefore the objective for the TNA project was to 
                                 create a system that could grow with the department and connect all the knowledge 
                                 it generated in a form that could bring internal benefits, but crucially, be 
                                 reused externally. By reforming this aspect of their work it could underpin their strategy and reach more people.
                            </p>


                        <h4 class="my-3">An Evolutionary Approach</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">Legacy databases can be difficult and expensive to change because of their technical 
                            inflexibility. Limited semantics and logic are built into the software, not the data, making the system 
                            dependent on technicians not invested in the content. The hidden cost was that, in not reflecting the 
                            reality of the department’s processes and strategy, it created both a resourcing overhead and an 
                            intellectual overhead that worked against professional development. Data went into the system but 
                            had no real objective. Professionals were servicing a system which provided little return providing 
                            little insight into how people approached and developed their work or how methods and techniques had 
                            changed overtime. It was a record with little educational or management benefit.  However, CCD did not 
                            have the time necessary to stop and conduct a detailed review of the department in one major exercise. Using 
                            ResearchSpace meant that an evolutionary route was possible and the system itself became a tool for change and new 
                            thinking. Initially the old data, which was still required, was cleaned and migrated to the CIDOC CRM, creating 
                            semantically explicit information in a flexible structure - a graph. Semantic data is higher quality and 
                            more precise but works within a flexible model which can be influenced more easily by subject experts 
                            themselves. Once the system was migrated to the new framework it could be developed collaboratively 
                            with a common goal to be transparent, educational, incorporate research, and better address new challenges. 
                            Disruption to the department was kept to a minimum and the system simply continued to change and grow 
                            incrementally. The data clean and semantic transformation was completed incrementally over a period of 4 weeks. 
                            The system was created from scratch in a similar time span providing a custom system without the usual 
                            timescale, resources and cost. Driven from the data, not the software, a custom system could be created 
                            without the need for custom support. The key ingredient was Kartography's understanding of the subject area, 
                            alongside its expertise in semantic technology.

                            Once a working system was available it was incorporated into the department immediately. This 
                            allowed the space for a fuller information exchange about how the department worked, 
                            how different sections within the department collaborated and how the department 
                            collaborated within the organisation and externally. It also allowed Kartography to 
                            describe how the new system operated and the possibilities available to people for 
                            its use in supporting the current practices of the department and to improve the system 
                            to make it more relevant, gradually introducing the concepts behind semantic data and 
                            new ways of thinking about data.

                            CCD used the records from the TNA Discovery system which documents the archive using 
                            the EAD system. The ResearchSpace system is able to connect with legacy API's and 
                            databases and dynamically convert data into a semantic format as and when needed. A Discovery 
                            interface was provided that allows CCD to find and import records from Discovery maintaining a 
                            link between the two. This also allows CCD to augment the records with material, scientific and 
                            historical information, including social and historical significance which is highly relevant to 
                            preservation and conservation processes.

                          <h4 class="my-3">Evolving the System</h4>

                         <p class="text-muted">
                            A review was undertaken in the context of the CCD strategy and 
                            a new version of the system was completed which incorporated an interconnected interface 
                            based on a project approach. However, projects are not simply separate standalone pieces of work. 
                            Projects are linked allowing past work to inform future work and provide a provenance of methods and 
                            techniques that can be traced. Collection items and the activities around them have a life which can now 
                            be traced and used to understand change and new developments. Complexity is supported by allowing CCD 
                            to break archive items up into components and features from which specific regions and points can be 
                            identified and used for precise representation of assessments, analysis, research and treatments that 
                            they carry out without resorting to interpreting text fields which previously were the only way to 
                            describe details. Version three of the system will focus on scientific integration and significance analysis.
