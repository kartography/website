				<p>ResearchSpace is based on the underlying way in which research is conducted in the 
          humanities. Researching the past is complex and is based on the investigation and collection
          of empirical evidence. However, these historical sources can reveal or hide, for example 
          deliberate obfuscation, institutional bias or the exercise of ideology and power. 
          Added to this there are gaps in historical evidence. Therefore
          historical disciplines need to build patterns of facts with may be mutually supportive or contradict and 
          use these patterns toward a progressive explanantion or interpretation. However, this is not a static process
         and empirical
          investigation continues which lead to better and improved explnantions. This evolution of knowledge and understanding 
          is itself an important part of research.  
          </p>
          <p>
          ResearchSpace allows you to investigate and collect facts. organise them into historical patterns and to
          draw conclusions. The conclusions are stored in the same sementic network as the empirical facts and patterns.
          In other words the full cycle from investigation, analysis and conclusion is reatined within one 
          structured data system. This allows meaningful communication between researchers in a structured additional systemmatic way.
          Its ontological framework ensures integration across the work of different researchers and through cooperation
          researchers investigations can build into quality quantitative data (linked back to the micro investigations) to
          inform historical generations. The separation between micro and macro is resolved and people can view history 
          through different levels of generality and link lived experience to social relations and wider systems.
