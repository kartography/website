        <p>Kartography are an interdisciplinary team drawing upon extensive experience of working within knowledge
          organisations including the Royal Academy of Arts,
          the British Museum and the National Gallery. Kartography expertise includes historical
          and social science methodology, computer science, knowledge systems, AI, semantic web, linked data and process
          analysis. The team also provide subject knowledge in history, 
          archaeology, art history, conservation and conservation science, ethnography, anthropology. This allows Kartography, together 
          with the ResearchSpace knowledge system developed by the
          team, to add significant benefits to knowledge processes and projects.
          The Kartography organisation is a Community Interest Company - a non-profit social enterprise. <a href="./about.html">Click

        <p class="sectitle"><b>What is ResearchSpace?</b></p>
        <p>ResearchSpace is a progressive alternative and successor to the database. It is a semantic knowledge base
          system
          designed to support dyanmic knowledge processes and create meaningful data more closely aligned with our
          thinking and
          reality. It can be used in research, within cultural heritage organisations and any other organisation for
          which
          dynamic knowledge building is an important part of its processes. ResearchSpace is an open source system with
          10 years of research and development funded by the Mellon Foundation, New York and has significant overlaps
          with
          artificial intelligence but from a human curated perspective. </p>

        <p>ResearchSpace has been designed to address many of the problems associated with representing complex data
          that databases are not designed to address. For more information about how ResearchSpace works <a

        <p class="sectitle"><b>Why are databases problematic for knowledge processes?</b></p>
        <p>Databases were not designed for complex semantic content. They were invented for the processing of
          commercial data used in supply chains. They had no need to include context because the scope of
          use built into their design was relatively narrow. The need to integrate with other organisations was not a
          priority
          at the time but as
          data integration became important for commercial processes databases created a problem even for the narrow
          types of data they processed. A huge amount of complexity is required to perform relatively simple
          integrations. Databases are essentially static and functional. Without semantics content is fixed and
          reductive. However, all sectors commercial, public and volunatry, now require holistic systems that can deal with dyanmic processes 
          and more complex problems and real world relational data.
          
          
          An example is produced here.</p>
          <p><b>databases - complexity - commercial - static - functional - reductive</b></p>
     

  
        <p class="sectitle"><b>How does ResearchSpace work?</b></p>
        <p>In order for different system to effectively communicate their need a common understanding. When we
          communicate
          we use different words and phrases to describe similar things. When information is processed through computers
          this
          can cause a serious problem and overhead. Every organisation is individual and has different
          perspectives and traditions, but on the other hand their is a greater need to integrate internally and
          externally on an interdisciplinary basis.
          Knowledge system work, not by limiting different ways of describing world but by
          providing a framework that identifies key universal concepts with empirical references to reality.
          In this way the human operator and the computer have a precise framework for agreement. This framework is
          highly meaningful. Instead of a database that only stores a field label and a value with a
          data type, ResearchSpace stores a semantic network of processes typed to real world concepts. This creates
          a highly effective knowledge base of information which can be dynamically extended and exchanged. </p>
          <p><b>language - reference to reality - integration - empirical framework - semantic network - dynamically extend</b></p>
      

<p class="sectitle"><b>Why is ResearchSpace more effective than a database?</b></p>

        <p>ResearchSpace solves some significant problems associated with databases, whether doing research or working
          in
          a skilled knowledge environment dependent on changing information. Databases have static models and no formal
          data semantics. They
          are designed to control a particular static set of information in quantity. However, knowledge is not a
          static concept. In both research and in many skilled jobs people are necessarily building knowledge far beyond
          these static models. As such they start using other mechanisms to record that additional knowledge which is
          more important to their work than that recorded by the database. This creates a significant overhead and
          an inefficiency invisible to the organisation.</p>

        <p>Information becomes fragmented which prevents individuals and organisations from working in an
          effective and connected way, and building valuable knowledge which otherwise fades away. Peter Drucker the
          organisational consultant
          who coined the phrase knowledge society, said that: “If knowledge isn’t challenged to grow, it disappears
          fast.”
          This is highly costly to all organisations
          and projects.</p>
          <p><b>not static but dyanmic - knowledge society - inefficiency of databases - preserving and using meaningful knowledge </b></p>
          
 
     <p class="sectitle"><b>How does kartography do?</b></p>
        <p>Kartography helps you transition from the one dimensional database to a new digital
          environment in which a wider range of knowledge can be authored with greater context and diversity.
          It helps design systems that include parallel perspectives, argument and uncertainty,
          multi-layered causation (influence). This often goes hand in hand with reviewing and changing internal
          processes to represent greater collaboration within and across departments and with external partners and
          audiences.</p>

        <p>Kartography are experienced at creating flexible knowledge systems that grow and evolve as human working
          elvoves without the overhead of a traditional custom system. All the meaning and logic is in the data making
          it
          easier to change the way ResearchSpace interacts and augments knowledge processes and work. </p>

        <p>Kartography provides courses in how to change the way people work to make better use of the knowledge they
          produced. To
          radical change the relationship with information systems and to create data systems that eliminate bias and
          represent context that improves inclusivity. It also provides connected courses in the technicalities
          of the Semantic Web and Linked data wothout separating the technical processes from social context. </p>
