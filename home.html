    <h2>Data to knowledge transformation services</h2>
    
    <p>Kartography can model and transform data into a richer and 
    flexible semantic form that brings out the explicit meaning and relationships
     hidden in data. This opens up opportunities for continually expanding the model 
     to meet new demands and questions. This work often involves correcting 
     data issues commonly embedded in traditional database systems which requires
      correction for a precise semantic environment. This consultancy is usually 
      made available when using our knowledge base services. </p>

      <div class="nextpage">
      <h2>Knowledge Process Consultancy </h2> 

      <p>Kartography can work with you to understand your knowledge processes 
      providing experience and expertise to inform a new knowledge base. 
      Often existing processes have been influenced to service an existing database system. 
      Kartography can help re-evaluate existing processes to inform and align with a new 
      Since a knowledge base system can evolve over time, this work can be informed by longer 
      term strategies or reviews of existing processes which have been determined by a traditional database. </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="nextpage">
        <h2>  Maximising Experience </h2>

<p>Kartography designs interfaces that reflect thinking processes. 
They can be changed and evolve to reflect changes and using the ResearchSpace 
system can allow users to generate their own models of information based on changing knowledge. 
The ResearchSpace system is designed to bring out the meaning in the data rather than provide 
its own semantics and this separation allows a flexible system for user experience which can also evolve.</p>
