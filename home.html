        <p class="sectitle"><b>Who are Kartography?</b></p>
        <p>Kartography are an interdisciplinary team drawing upon extensive experience of working in knowledge
          organisations including the Royal Academy of Arts,
          the British Museum and the National Gallery. Kartography are the developers of
          <a href="http://www.researchspace.org">ResearchSpace</a>, a knowledge base
          platform
          that supports evolving knowledge processes using meaningful context. 
          <p>The nature of knowledge production has changed significantly over the last 50 years. Traditional information systems are narrowly bounded within a partiuclar discipline or function using static models,
          but modern knowledge processes require
          the application of a wider range of semantically precise information and a transdisciplinary approach.
          People and organisations need a framework in which
          knowledge can evolve and change over time, with provenance. Most information systems employ static models 
          without the flexibility and semantics to
          address increasingly complex questions, whether in education and research or other
          information rich sectors.</p>

            <p class="sectitle"><b>What is ResearchSpace?</b></p>

        <p> <a href="http://www.researchspace.org">ResearchSpace</a> is a progressive alternative and successor to 
          the database. It is a semantic knowledge base
          system
          designed to support dyanmic knowledge processes and create meaningful data closely aligned with
          thinking, evidence and
          reality. It can be used in research, within cultural heritage organisations and any other organisation for
          which
          dynamic knowledge building is an important part of its processes. </p>
          <p>ResearchSpace is an open source system with
          10 years of research and development funded by the Mellon Foundation, New York and has significant overlaps
          with
          artificial intelligence from a human curated perspective. ResearchSpace has been designed to address many of the problems associated with representing complex data
          that databases are not designed to address. For more information about how ResearchSpace works <a

        <!--<p><b>progressive - semantic data - dynamic data - knowledge base not database - Mellon Foundation </b></p>-->



        <p class="sectitle"><b>Why are databases problematic for knowledge processes?</b></p>
        <p>Databases were not designed for complex semantic content. They were created in the 1960s for processing
          commercial data used in supply chains. At the time they had no need to include context because the scope of
          their use was relatively narrow. However, this is no longer true for modern organisations. There is
          a general need to comminicate across boundaries using data with clarity of meaning. 
          Databases create a significant overhead requiring a large amount of complexity to perform relatively simple
          tasks. Databases are essentially static and functional. Without semantics their content is fixed and
          reductive. However, all sectors commercial, public and volunatry, now require dynamic, transdisciplinary,
          holistic systems that
          can deal with more complex problems using precise meaningful relational data.
        </p>
        <!--<p><b>databases - complexity - commercial - static - functional - reductive</b></p>-->



        <p class="sectitle"><b>How does ResearchSpace work?</b></p>
        <p>In order for different system to effectively communicate their need a common understanding. When we
          communicate
          we use different words and phrases to describe similar things. When information is processed through computers
          this
          can cause serious problems. Every organisation is individual and has different
          perspectives and traditions.
          Knowledge system work, by providing a framework based on real world empirical concepts.
          In this way both human and the computer have common framework under which heterogenious information can be
          represented
          and interconnected. The flexibility needed for human knowledge processes is supported but with all the advantages
          of computer processesing to cope with large amounts of data but essentially based on meaningful qualitative 
          information.
          Instead of a database that only stores a
          field label and a value with a
          data type, ResearchSpace stores a semantic network of processes typed to the real world. This creates
          a highly effective knowledge base of information which can be dynamically extended and exchanged. </p>
      <!--  <p><b>language - reference to reality - integration - empirical framework - semantic network - dynamically
            extend</b></p> -->


        <p class="sectitle"><b>Why is ResearchSpace more effective than a database?</b></p>

        <p>ResearchSpace solves some significant problems associated with databases, whether doing research or working
          in
          a skilled knowledge environment dependent on changing information. Databases have static models and no formal
          data semantics. They
          are designed to control a particular static set of information in quantity. However, knowledge is not a
          static concept. In both research and in many skilled jobs people are necessarily building knowledge far beyond
          these static models. As such they start using other mechanisms to record that additional knowledge which is
          more important to their work than that recorded by the database. This creates a significant productivity 
          and risk overhead - an inefficiency invisible to the organisation.</p>

        <p>Information becomes fragmented which prevents individuals and organisations from working in an
          effective and connected way, and building valuable knowledge which otherwise fades away. Peter Drucker the
          organisational consultant
          who coined the phrase knowledge society, said that: “If knowledge isn’t challenged to grow, it disappears
          fast.”
          This is highly costly to all organisations
          and projects.</p>

        <p class="sectitle"><b>How does kartography do?</b></p>
        <p>Kartography helps you transition from abstract one dimensional thinking to a new digital
          environment in which a wider range of knowledge can be authored with greater context and diversity.
          It helps design systems that include parallel perspectives, argument and uncertainty,
          multi-layered causation (influence). This often goes hand in hand with reviewing and changing internal
          processes to represent greater collaboration within and across departments and with external partners and
          audiences.</p>

        <p>Kartography are experienced at creating flexible knowledge systems that grow and evolve as human working
          evolves without the overhead of a traditional bespoke system. All the meaning and logic is in the data making
          it
          easier to change the way ResearchSpace interacts and augments knowledge processes and decision making. </p>

        <p>Kartography provides courses in how to change the way people work to make better use of the knowledge they
          produce. To
          radical change the relationship with information systems and to create data systems that eliminate bias and
          represent context that improves inclusivity. It also provides connected courses in the technicalities
          of the Semantic Web and Linked data wothout separating the technical processes from social context. </p>
